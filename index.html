      <h1>Yi-Jyun Pan / <code>pan93412</code></h1>

      <p>
        I am a backend intern at <a href="https://zeabur.com">Zeabur</a> and an
        undergraduate based in Kaohsiung, Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼. I design, translate, and
        occasionally contribute to open-source software (OSS).

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer with expertise in a wide range of
          technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the frontend, I utilize modern tools such as React.js, TypeScript,
          Vite, and Next.js. This homepage itself is built using Vite as the
          bundler.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the backend, my development skills include proficiency in languages
          like
          <a href="https://github.com/nkust-monitor-iot-project-2024/central"
          >Go</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/nkust-monitor-iot-project-2024/iot-system"
          >Rust</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/database-playground/app-sf">PHP</a>, and
          Node.js.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have extensive experience with PaaS solutions like Zeabur, ensuring
          applications run seamlessly on such platforms. Additionally, I am
          proficient with cloud providers including AWS (EC2, SES), GCP (GCE),
          Cloudflare (R2), and DigitalOcean (Droplet, Docker registry). I am
          expert in Git and has been adapted to established contribution flows
          and committing guidelines, such as <a
            href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/"
          >Conventional Commits</a>, and CI/CD pipelines primarily using GitHub
          Actions. I also collaborate on a Docker-based builder solution, <a
            href="https://github.com/zeabur/zbpack"
          >Zeabur Pack</a>, and work extensively with Kubernetes, which
          underpins Zeabur's infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          I prefer cloud-native and scalable solutions. I have applied
          microservice architectures and techniques on several projects, for
          example:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/nkust-monitor-iot-project-2024/central"
            >NKUST IC IoT Projects (Go, 2024/06)</a>: Written in Go, applied
            RabbitMQ, GraphQL, gRPC, OpenTelemetry, mTLS, PostgreSQL, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://github.com/nkust-monitor-iot-project-2024/iot-system"
            >NKUST IC IoT Projects (Rust, 2024/12)</a>: Written in Rust, applied
            S3 (R2), GraphQL, NATS, PostgreSQL, etc. Communicates entirely with
            NATS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/database-playground/app-sf"
            >Database Playground</a>: Mostly monolithic, but <a
              href="https://github.com/database-playground/sqlrunner-v2"
            >some services</a> have been split as HTTP services. It used to <a
              href="https://github.com/database-playground/backend-go"
            >be in the microservice structure</a>, but I found Symfony was more
            suitable for rapid development and prototype validation.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I consistently explore best practices and scalable solutions in
          software engineering to maintain high code quality. Feel free to share
          your opinions with me!
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, I design apps using Swift for the Apple ecosystem and
          React Native as an amateur. I have experience with the development of
          macOS and iOS apps, such as <a
            href="https://github.com/pan93412/string-catalog-merger"
          >A Helper for Merging the String Catalog</a> and helping improve
          concurrency in some Swift projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond development, I engage in data analysis with Python, supported
          by training from NKUST IC, and possess skills in prompt engineering
          with OpenAI GPT models. I also create designs, which can be viewed on
          my <a href="https://figma.com/@pan93412">Figma community profile</a>,
          though my portfolio there is seldom updated.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am an active contributor to open-source projects such as Symfony,
          Git, Keka, and various GNU software. Additionally, I actively
          participate in several developer communities on Telegram and Discord,
          where you can often find me.
        </p>

        <p>
          My development environment is built on a powerful MacBook Pro
          utilizing Nix and <a href="https://devenv.sh">Devenv</a>. I favor VS
          Code over JetBrains' IDEs due to better compatibility with Devenv.
